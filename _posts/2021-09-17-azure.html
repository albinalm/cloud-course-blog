<h1>Serverless computing in a nutshell</h1>
<p>First of all "Serverless hosting" isn't really serverless at all, so the one who came up with the name kind of sucks. But if you look at it from the right angle and maybe with a telescope you might get why it's called like that. <br>
Well, the reason being that it's a way to manage your back-end server without paying for or hosting your own server. You basically publish the service at your provider and be charged per use/computation instead of continous debiting. 
Long story short, it's named serverless because the developer doesn't need to worry about any servers, not because theres isn't any.</p>
<h2>Function-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Function as a service(Faas) is one of many serverless methods. It's primarily used to execute smaller events and running code reactively on demand. In this article i'll soon talk about how I made a calculator API as a <strong>FaaS</strong>. <br>
Instead of making the entire library and hosting it on a server and giving response to each request, I can host it on for instance Azure as a FaaS. There it can be executed directly in the cloud and I only need to pay each time it's executed. This makes it very flexible and cost efficient. It's paying for each MB when using your mobile network instead of having a fixed amount. Sometimes you don't use up everything and you end up wasting money. </p>
