<h1>Serverless computing in a nutshell</h1>
<p>First of all "Serverless hosting" isn't really serverless at all, so the one who came up with the name kind of sucks. But if you look at it from the right angle and maybe with a telescope you might get why it's called like that. <br>
Well, the reason being that it's a way to manage your back-end server without paying for or hosting your own server. You basically publish the service at your provider and be charged per use/computation instead of continous debiting. 
Long story short, it's named serverless because the developer doesn't need to worry about any servers, not because theres isn't any.</p>
<h2>Function-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Function as a service(Faas) is one of many serverless methods. It's primarily used to execute smaller events and running code reactively on demand. In this article i'll soon talk about how I made a calculator API as a <strong>FaaS</strong>. <br>
Instead of making the entire library and hosting it on a server and giving response to each request, I can host it on for instance Azure as a FaaS. There it can be executed directly in the cloud and I only need to pay each time it's executed. This makes it very flexible and cost efficient. 
It's like paying for each MB when using your mobile network instead of having a fixed amount. Sometimes you don't use up everything and you end up wasting money.</p>
<h5>Advantages of serverless & FaaS</h5>
<p>There are many advantages of using FaaS, some of them being:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Focusing on whats important.</strong> FaaS saves developers the headache of worrying about servers and operation.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing.</strong> FaaS scales according to your needs. No need to pay for operating servers, just paying for the service & code</li>
    <li><strong>Less worrying about capacity,</strong> Need more services? More computing? No need to upgrade your infrastructure. Just keep adding, since it scales to your demand. This point ties into the first one.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Disadvantages of serverless & FaaS</h5>
<p>Obviously such thing also comes with it's downsides. In some cases there is just simply better to do it yourself!</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pricing.</strong> This is kinda funny because it was also an advantage. Don't forget that you also pay for service and platform contribution. If you plan your own build well and are efficient it will be cheaper to host yourself in the long run. Bothersome,  but cheaper.</li>
    <li><strong>Vendor lock-in.</strong> You become tied to your vendor. If you change your mind later on it is a very troublesome task to migrate -  even if vendors tell you it's simple.</li>
    <li><strong>Control.</strong> You place your code and infrastructure in hands of others. This might be a good thing because you can focus on development, but in the end you are still out of reach if something happens.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing a FaaS calculator API with a CI pipeline</h2>

<br><br>

<h5>Setting up the project</h5>
<p>I tried this out and developed a library to do some "quick mafs" and then return the result. I did this directly in the Azure portal.<br><br>
First and foremost when arriving at the Azure portal, I created a new "Function app" and added a function called "Calculate". The language for this library is C#.

The code will take the variable "input" in a post request, attempt to calculate it and return the result as a string. Pretty simple.</p>

<h5>Connecting the application to a GitHub repository.</h5>
<p>Before doing anything I made an empty repository in my GitHub profile. <br>To connect my application I first navigated to the "Distribution center" tab in my application overview. From there I connected to the repository and generated a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;"><strong>Personal access token.</strong></a>
<br>Doing this generates a workflow file in the repository</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/azure/azure_02.jpg">
<p>Basically I was now connected to my empty repository with a broken workflow pipeline. Doesn't sound very good does it? But despite how it sounds, it's actually exactly what I wanted, since I now had everything I needed to set up my CI pipe!<br><br>
To begin making the repository in sync with the Azure project and making <strong>Dotnet restore</strong> work in the pipeline, I cloned the empty repository in VSCode and downloaded the source files from Azure.<br></p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/azure/azure_03.jpg">
<p>Afterards pasting all of these source files in the cloned repository folder and pushing.<br>
<strong>Voila!</strong> GitHub repository was now in sync with the Azure project.</p>
<h5>Configuring the pipeline</h5>
<p>Now, configuring my pipeline was actually a bit of trial and error since the default one doesn't really work out of the box.<br>
Initially I had to fix the typo regarding what .NET version to use.</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/azure/azure_gh_01.jpg">
<p>This was changed to 2.0 since that is what the Azure project is based upon. I learned this by first running 5.0 and getting error messages regarding that it was missing 2.0 libraries.<br>
After making this fix, the pipeline works fine and I could now make changes to my project in VSCode, push it to the main branch and letting it get updated on Azure automatically. <strong>Super smooth!</strong>

<h5>Validating & testing code</h5>
<p>In this case scenario I tested my code directly in the GUI in Azure. This is because the code can only have 3 different outcomes, so there was no need for ambigious testing solutions. <br><br>
But the thought to it is just as important. Were I to implement tests for this project I'd first make a test project for the API, and setup some fancy tests. In the workflow file I would add a section for <strong>Dotnet test</strong> to validate my code before pushing to Azure.<br>
Obviously this test project might not be valid and not detected in Azure, but that isn't relevant either. Whats important is that my pipeline can execute the tests and then if it succeeds continue pushing to Azure. Testing the code in Azure itself isn't really required if you do it this way.<br><br>
This can be done in a number of ways, but that is how I would do it on this project. <br>
<strong>Setup job > Pre-checkout > Setup DotNet > Restore project > Test project > Push to Azure > Post-checkout</strong></p>
<h5>Security risks</h5>
<p>The most obvious security flaw in this solution is injection. This is not limited to these kind of serverless applications, but generally a weakness in RESTful API:s. <br>
Injection means that you can enter different types of code in the request via for instance Postman or directly in the address bar. If there is no proper validation, the host computer will read this code and execute it. <br>
An example of a common SQL injection when breaching logins is giving a statement that always returns true. When you attempt to validate a login, the result will always be either true or false. By injecting your login request with random credentials and adding "or 0=0" the statement will always return true and you will be authorized to access desired resources.<br>
The best solution to this is always validating what passes through and thus making sure you only get what you are expecting. <br><br>
If you think this is interesting I strongly suggest you checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RootOfTheNull" target="_blank" style="color:cornflowerblue !important;">John Hammond's YouTube channel</a> where he talks and demonstrates about these subjects.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This was way less work than I first anticipated. This is because Microsoft offers very good automated services for implementing these kind of things. I imagine for a novice this would be difficult to setup manually without any templates. <br>
My personal opinion though is that it's very good we have these fast ways of implementing services. Generally speaking some automated processing is frowned down upon because it's "cooler" to do it yourself. Absolutely, but doing it manually is like running a marathon without shoes.</p>
