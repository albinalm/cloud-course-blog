<h1>Serverless computing in a nutshell</h1>
<p>First of all "Serverless hosting" isn't really serverless at all, so the one who came up with the name kind of sucks. But if you look at it from the right angle and maybe with a telescope you might get why it's called like that. <br>
The reason for it being that it's a way to manage your back-end server without paying for- or hosting a server. Instead you publish the service at your provider and instead you will be charged per use/computation instead of continous debiting.</p>
