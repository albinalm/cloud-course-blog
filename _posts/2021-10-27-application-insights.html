<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h2>What is application insights?</h2>
<p>Application insights is a feature in Azure that you can use to trace application events. The monitoring both catches error messages thrown client-side but also server-side.<br>
    You can add this monitoring service to basically all your Azure apps and also use Microsoft own query language called "Kusto Queries" to make interactive charts and filter your messages and errors.
</p>
<h3>Adding Appliation insights to an Azure Function</h3>
<p>For this demonstration i baked a web-app together with an azure function using old code. It's a basic calculator in ASP.NET that uses SignalR to update the GUI and an Azure Function to make the calculation.</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/application_insights/01.jpg"><br>
<p>But what is interesting is that you can use the existing ILogger instance to send information that Application Insight will automatically pick up without any configuration.<br> <br>
<strong>First of all</strong> add logging to your existing function. My logging looks like this:
<br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/application_insights/02.jpg"><br><br>
I purposely decided to only log my errors to keep the log as clean as possible. But you can log everything from errors, warnings or just information. <br>
Depending if you just log a message, warning or error they get different severityLevels that you can use to filter them out, but more on that later.
<h5>Explaining the code</h5>
The code itself is very straightforward. We begin by reading the input JSON body and looking for a input property.
If <i>"input"</i> doesn't exist we will log an <strong>error</strong> that we're missing important data.
Although if this passes we will then attempt to calculate the formula put in input. If this process fails we will instead report an <strong>error</strong> containing the details of the exception.<br>
This part can be built even further. You could for instance add a stopwatch to count the time taken to make the calculation and then log a warning if the timer exceeds a certain amount. <br>
This isn't necessary for this application since it only makes simple mathematical equations.
<br><br>
Now that you have logging activated publish your function app through GitHub or Visual Studio. I used a CI Pipeline through GitHub to publish mine. <br>
When you can access the function in the Azure Portal you can activate logging by being on the function overview and going to the <strong>"Application Insights"</strong> tab. <br>

Now you have monitoring activated on the app.

<br>
<h3>Different type of severities</h3>
<p>When logging to Appliation Insights you can use different methods to specify the severity level of the messages. The severity levels are as following: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>LogInformation</li>
        <li>LogWarning</li>
        <li>LogError</li>
        <li>LogFatal</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
Most of these are actually pretty simple. <br><br>
Information is when you just wish to store a certain message, maybe you just want to know if the code reached a certain point. This is kind of like Console.WriteLine where you just output relevant <strong>information.</strong><br><br>
LogWarning is used for example when the code will fulfill it's purpose and the application will keep running, but there might be a property or a variable with a value that might cause problems later. Basically a heads up telling you this might cause bigger problems down the line with the butterly effect.<br><br>
LogError is when the application fails doing something, although the failure not being critical to the business. Maybe just a calculation or a method fails, but the core application itself are still up and running.<br><br>
Lastly we have the elephant in the room, the thing you actually never wish to see... The <strong>fatal</strong> type. This means something went very wrong. The core application maybe crashed or something failed that is critical for the organization. These types of errors usually require fast reactions since they can have a big impact on the organization.

</p>
<h3>Data flow and queries</h3>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/application_insights/04.jpg"><br>
The flow here is quite simple. The end-user connects to our App Service and calls the azure function by making a calculation. If something goes wrong, let's say incorrect syntax, null values or any other thing that causes the process to fail it will send an error message to the logging instance which Application Insights will pick up.
We can then monitor Application Insights and take action if neccessary.
<br><br>
<h5>Creating custom queries</h5>
<p>One of the great things about Azure monitoring is that you can create queries to filter data exactly to your needs. This very useful since the amounts of messages can in a large application become obnoxious. Even if you make sure only to log relevant information there are other baseline messages being logged.<br>
<strong>List severities with a minimum level of 3(Errors and fatals)</strong><br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/application_insights/05.jpg"><br><br>
<strong>List all traces between two dates</strong><br>

These queries are very simple by nature. But if you were to have a more ambigious logging enabled you could customize this to your wildest dreams!<br>
With support for graphical presentation as well using the term <strong>render</strong> together with a <i>type</i> such as chart you can get visual presentations instead.
Let us say you always log response time on your application. You could then create a query to gather all response time information and then present you a visual graph of the average time, or maybe how many times the time exceeded a set amount?<br>
You can also use these queries to filter out information regarding visits to your webiste. You could see exactly how many times your razor page loads per day in average.
The possibilities are endless and thats why Azure Application Insights are used by so many companies today. It's such a powerful tool that is very accessible, easily configurable and easy to use!
With proper logging you can enable monitoring that automatically alarms if a certain message was triggered. This way you can get notified immediately if something happened that shouldn't.
