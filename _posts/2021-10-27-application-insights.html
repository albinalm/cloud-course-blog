<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h2>What is application insights?</h2>
<p>Application insights is a feature in Azure that you can use to trace application events. The monitoring both catches error messages thrown client-side but also server-side.<br>
    You can add this monitoring service to basically all your Azure apps and also use Microsoft own query language called "Kusto Queries" to make interactive charts and filter your messages and errors.
