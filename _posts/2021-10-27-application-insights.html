<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h2>What is application insights?</h2>
<p>Application insights is a feature in Azure that you can use to trace application events. The monitoring both catches error messages thrown client-side but also server-side.<br>
    You can add this monitoring service to basically all your Azure apps and also use Microsoft own query language called "Kusto Queries" to make interactive charts and filter your messages and errors.
</p>
<h3>Adding Appliation insights to an Azure Function</h3>
<p>For this demonstration i baked a web-app together with an azure function using old code. It's a basic calculator in ASP.NET that uses SignalR to update the GUI and an Azure Function to make the calculation.</p>

<p>But what is interesting is that you can use the existing ILogger instance to send information that Application Insight will automatically pick up without any configuration.</p>
