<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h2>What is application insights?</h2>
<p>Application insights is a feature in Azure that you can use to trace application events. The monitoring both catches error messages thrown client-side but also server-side.<br>
    You can add this monitoring service to basically all your Azure apps and also use Microsoft own query language called "Kusto Queries" to make interactive charts and filter your messages and errors.
</p>
<h3>Adding Appliation insights to an Azure Function</h3>
<p>For this demonstration i baked a web-app together with an azure function using old code. It's a basic calculator in ASP.NET that uses SignalR to update the GUI and an Azure Function to make the calculation.</p>

<p>But what is interesting is that you can use the existing ILogger instance to send information that Application Insight will automatically pick up without any configuration.<br> <br>
<strong>First of all</strong> add logging to your existing function. My logging looks like this:
<br>

I purposely decided to only log my errors to keep the log as clean as possible. But you can log everything from errors, warnings or just information. <br>
Depending if you just log a message, warning or error they get different severityLevels that you can use to filter them out, but more on that later.
<h5>Explaining the code</h5>
The code itself is very straightforward. We begin by reading the input JSON body and looking for a input property.
If <i>"input"</i> doesn't exist we will log an <strong>error</strong> that we're missing important data.
Although if this passes we will then attempt to calculate the formula put in input. If this process fails we will instead report an <strong>error</strong> containing the details of the exception.<br>
This part can be built even further. You could for instance add a stopwatch to count the time taken to make the calculation and then log a warning if the timer exceeds a certain amount. <br>
This isn't necessary for this application since it only makes simple mathematical equations.s
<br><br>
Now that you have logging activated publish your function app through GitHub or Visual Studio. I used a CI Pipeline through GitHub to publish mine. <br>
When you can access the function in the Azure Portal you can activate logging by being on the function overview and going to the <strong>"Application Insights"</strong> tab. <br>

Now you have monitoring activated on the app.

<br>
<h3>Data flow and queries</h3>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/application_insights/04.jpg"><br>
The flow here is quite simple. The end-user connects to our App Service and calls the azure function by making a calculation. If something goes wrong, let's say incorrect syntax, null values or any other thing that causes the process to fail it will send an error message to the logging instance which Application Insights will pick up.
We can then monitor Application Insights and take action if neccessary.
