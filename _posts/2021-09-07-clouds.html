<h1>First of all, what is even a cloud?</h1>
<p>Well, aside from a composition of gases and ice crystals floating around above us, it can also mean an assortment of computers giving resources as a hosting platform for your services and applications.</p>
<h2>But, how does it work?</h2>
<p>Cloud computing works by providing different types of resources on demand randing from hosting applications or providing storage.</p>
<p>You can upload and access your files, or maybe keep your application running for as long as you want without using your own computer resources. This can for instance be achieved via a wide range of computers on the same network, working in symbiosis to share their workforce between users.</p>
<p>In many cases, this back-end solution is often combined with a front-end service to make it easy for users to manage their things. I bet you have used iCloud, Dropbox or maybe Google Drive. All of these are storage clouds that let you store your files on their remote computers instead of your own.</p>
<p>In other cases(for some techy-savvy people) there are cloud services without a straight forward, easy and accessible front-end. This might be used as a platform to host your application and keep it running. An example of such service is Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h3>Why should you use cloud computing?</h3>
<p>There are several advantages of the cloud. Many of which I personally believe why it will become the future of hosting and services.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> More flexible payment since you can choose to pay only per use. This can make the service cheaper for you to use instead of hosting yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability.</strong> Cloud computing is very reliable. They are being serviced, upgraded and managed regularely by the provider, so you won't need to.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> You can access your resource wherever you may be. Although this can be setup anyways via your own network to your own server, you won't need go through all of that hassle.</li>
    <li><strong>Ease-of-mind.</strong> These service providers always keep several server snapshots and other backups which makes recovery hassle-free and fast.</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity.</strong> Cloud computing have basically limitless* capacity. Most providers today just expand on need which means you as a customer can only pick what you need without worrying about hitting any roof.</li>
   
</ul>
<h3>And the bad stuff?</h3>
<p>Obviously there are several downsides to this. I will list a few of them below</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Security.</strong> Since clouds must be accessible for anyone, it utilizes the internet for communication. This means that if the wrong person with the right brain and the right tools choose to attack your application or service, they very much can.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing.</strong> I also listed this as an advantage, and that is because it can actually be both. Buying your own infrastructure cost alot, but most often just once. Then it's kinda there and going for as long as you'd like(With some costs to service and upgrades on the way), while you will need to continously pay for a cloud service. Keep in mind you don't just pay for the hardware, you pay for the serivce as well. That means in the long run it will become more expensive.</li>
    <li><strong>Downtime.</strong> can be a huge issue. Considering how large the cloud is, these providers require huge amounts of bandwith. This obviously leads to inevitable outages.</li>
    <li><strong>Control.</strong> This is a bit related to the reason above, since if there is a central problem you cannot really solve it alone. You are dependent on the providers and this can be scary for some and very bad if you have a service that just can't afford to go down. Obviously there are redundancy solutions, but these aren't free which makes us come back to our first point.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Many solutions probably have a package to suit your goals, but if it doesn't that is it. You cannot customize the setup to your specific needs in a way that you can with your own infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Lock-in.</strong> This means it is difficult to migrate to another provider. Let's say you are a trusty user, but something happens in their organization which turns their service very bad. If you are nestled in their service it's not "just swap". There is many project hours involved which definitely isn't cheap. Especially if you are a larger concern.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Pricing examples</h3>
<p>Now, saying this cost <strong>x</strong> much is impossible. This is because of my point above; the pricing is very specific depending on your usage.</p>
<p>But to give any form of number I'll present some prices I got using the calculators below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/" style="color:cornflowerblue !important;">Azure pricing calculator</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://calculator.aws/#/" style="color:cornflowerblue !important;">Amazon Web Services(AWS) pricing calculator</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/" style="color:cornflowerblue !important;">Google Cloud pricing calculator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For these examples I have made an estimate of an average computer with enough processing power to keep several applications running continously. On top of it I've picked an SQL server as well with a single database instance.</p>
<p>This setup is perfect for smaller companies or if you just wan't to host smaller services/applications.</p>

<br>
<h4>Microsoft Azure</h4>
<p>As you may notice Microsoft Azure is way more expensive than the others. The server itself isn't really anymore powerful. The reason Azure is more expensive is because you also pay for their service.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently leading the cloud business regarding hosting and providing several features and support that other providers cannot.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Amazon Web Services(AWS)</h4>
<p>This is the middle ground where you pay for brand and good support whilst not really getting the full cake as you might get with Microsoft. Although this option is much cheaper.</p>

<br>

<h4>Google Cloud</h4>
<p>This is the cheapest of them all and as well being easy to use and manage. Although the support is limited and you're more left to rely on docs and community instead of personal support.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>I think cloud computing is awesome! The infrastrucutre is already really impressive, and it will be exciting to see how it looks in the future. Regarding which provider to pick I'd say it depends on your usage. If you are a bigger company I'd suggest Microsoft for the amazing tools and support it offers. But if you are a smaller company or just wish to host something for your home, I'd recommend Google Clouds. 
    The GUI makes it really easy to use with still good documentation and community support while being really aggressive on the pricing.
