<h1>First of all, what is even a cloud?</h1>
<p>Well, aside from a composition of gasses and ice crystals floating around above us, it can also mean an assortment of computers giving resources as a hosting platform for your services and applications.</p>
<h2>But, how does it work?</h2>
<p>Cloud computing works by providing different types of resources on demand randing from hosting applications or providing storage.</p>
<br><p>You can upload and access your files, or maybe keep your application running for as long as you want without using your own computer resources. This can for instance be achieved via a wide range of computers on the same network, working in symbiosis to share their workforce between users.</p>
<p>In many cases, this back-end solution is often combined with a front-end service to make it easy for users to manage their things. I bet you have used iCloud, Dropbox or maybe Google Drive. All of these are storage clouds that let you store your files on their remote computers instead of your own.</p>
<p>In other cases(for some techy-people) there are cloud services without a straight forward, easy and accessible front-end. This might be used as a platform to host your application. An example of such service is Microsoft Azure.</p>
