<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
In this article I'll pick a scenario where we have a CTO who is very sceptical. I mean all techies are, but this one is just a bit more spiced up than usual.<br>
Anyway my job is to convince him to implement a enterprise bus. In this case Azure Service Bus. Unfortunately the CTO is not on board this train, because the data cannot be transferred publicly over the internet. <br>
I will attempt to convince our CTO by using facts and tell him this problem can be solved with Azure Private Link.
