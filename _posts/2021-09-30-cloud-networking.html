<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
In this article I'll pick a scenario where we have a CTO who is very sceptical. I mean all techies are, but this one is just a bit more spiced up than usual.<br>
Anyway my job is to convince him to implement a enterprise bus which in this case is Azure Service Bus. Unfortunately the CTO is not on board with this train because the data cannot be transferred publicly over the internet. <br>
I will attempt to convince our CTO by using facts and tell him this problem can be solved with Azure Private Link.
</p>
<h2>What is Azure Service Bus?</h2>
<p>
    <h5>Workflow comparison</h5>
    To begin understanding how we can secure a connection between our services and clients through Azure, we must first know what Azure Service Bus is.<br><br>
    Azure Service Bus is kind of like a postman. Everytime we wish to tell our applicaton something we need to send a message and this mesasge can contain anything from data to instructions. Think of it like sending a letter or package. <br>
    The enterprise bus will manage all of these messages and make sure they end up where they should and the really cool part about it is that all of it are done asynchronously. <br><br>
    This solution can greatly increase workflow and make our application feel alot more snappier. Instead of letting our application wait for the entire process when we need something - we can just validate all the necessary information, put the request in the service bus and let it do all the work behind the curtains. The front-end user can get an OK message right after the data has been validated instead of waiting for the process to fully complete.<br><br>
    Let's say we have a webshop. When the user has finished ordering, we can either let the customer wait several minutes for the entire process to complete, or make the customer wait 30 seconds while we validate the data. If all is good, we can do the rest asynchronously and tell the customer we're working on the order. If all back-end succeeds we can just send an email with confirmation. <br><br>
    Below is a couple of images showing you the difference between a stone-age-style of handling orders, versus using a service bus:<br>

    <h5>Bulk management</h5>
    Everytime we give the enterprise bus something to do(Let's say 50 people order in 3 seconds), all of these messages will be added to what's called a message queue. That means they will be sent in the order they came in. This is called the FIFO principle which stands for First-in, First-out. <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/fifo" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">You can read more about it here</a> <br>
    Obviously, these messages is highly configurable, so we can give messages different priority queues.<br><br>
    <h5>Managing stuck messages</h5>
    Every message can have a set TTL(Time to live), this is basically a stopwatch telling a message to be dropped if nothing happens if a certain amount of time. Although a message can be "prepared for sending", this will override the TTL since it's already locked and loaded for being sent.<br><br>
    <h5>Managing failed messages</h5>
    The enterprise bus has something that is called a DLQ. This stands for <i>Dead letter queue</i>. That is a little room where messages land that fails. In the DLQ there is no TTL, since we do not want our failed messages to be removed because we need them for troubleshooting.<br>
    The DLQ can also have monitoring, giving us an alarm when a message has failed so we can investigate immediately.<br><br>
    <h5>Security</h5>
    Above is just an example in how an enterprise bus can improve our platform. This case scenario can be customized in many ways, and there is just a better way of handling our data. <br>
    By implementing this we can use Azure PaaS which has many advantages since we can focus more on production & development instead of operations. But to adress the elephant in the room; Security we'll need to talk about Azure Private Link and how that will prevent our communiations to be done publicly.
</p>
<h2>How can we secure our data transfers?</h2>
<h5>Virtual Private Cloud</h5>
<p>
    A virtual private cloud is a platform and environment for keeping virtual machines and services running.
    This allows us to combine the security of private hosting, with the scalabilty and flexibility with public cloud hosting. <br>
    This is also called VNet which stands for Virtual Network.<br>
    <br>
    The VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) offered by Azure is completely isolated from the public cloud and is highly configurable which means we can decide and monitor all data passthrough.<br><br>
    <h5>VPC Accessibility</h5>
    To access our VPC outside of the office we'll need to implement a VPN solution, which stands for virtual private network.<br>
    A VPN is basically like a tunnel that goes between your client and the resource. This tunnel is "underground" and isolated from the rest of the public internet.<br>
    By establishing a VPN connection we can simulate being on-prem over the internet while still maintaining the same security levels as physically being on that network.
    <br><br>
    <h5>Azure ExpressRoute</h5>
    Microsoft has developed something that they call "Microsoft Backbone". This is a isolated network owned, controlled and maintained by Microsoft. It is highly ambitious and secure and completely paralell from the internet.<br>
    By implementing Azure ExpressRoute we can connect our VNet through the backbone to our private on-prem network. All the Azure traffic will route through ExpressRoute instead of the internet and thus never exposing our data on the internet.<br><br>
    <h5>Azure Private Link</h5>
    Azure Private Link is our solution to connecting our VNet, Azure Resources and on-prem networks on a private link(pun intended) to keep the data secure and off the internet.
    This data instead travels through the same backbone as mentioned above but without using any public IP.
    <br>
    By implementing a private endpoint in the VNet, which acts as a NIC-adapter with it's own private IP adress and then linking our Azure resource to that endpoint using Azure Private Link we can then connect to our Azure Resources without ever using a public IP adress!<br>
    On top of this, we can configure rules and access groups on the VM in our VNet to control what we want to pass through this link.
    Every private endpoint is only linked to a single resource. This avoids any data leakage since every resource is isolated from eachother.
    <br><br>
    Connecting resources with private endpoints is highly flexible since we can connect the same resource to multiple endpoints and thus letting our clients access resources on demand by setting up a private endpoint on their VNet the same way we did on ours.<br>
</p><br><br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Both ExpressRoute and PrivateLink utilizes the highly secure backbone, the difference is that Private Link let us use a private IP adress instead of our public IP when accessing our resource using the private NIC-adapter on the VNet. This can be good for security reasons since we can completely block public IP adresses via our firewall when connecting to our resource.<br>
    See image below for example:<br>
    <img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cloud_networking/03.jpg"><br><br>
    All in all, we will be able to monitor and control all passthrough completely while being isolated from the network while still taking advantage of Azure services and their flexible scalabilty and pricing.<br>
    We can let operations be led by the professional teams at Microsoft, expand resources at will without any involvement without sacrificing any security. All we need is a proper setup using the above tools, and we have a extraordinary platform to expand upon and being set for the future!
