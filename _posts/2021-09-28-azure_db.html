<h1>Cloud based database</h1>
<p>For todays post I recently made a quick app to demonstrate how you can use a CosmosDB with Azure together with a REST-API through Azure Functions and automatically deploy using a CI Pipeline.</p>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Well, first of all this wasn't as easy as I first thought. But through some trial and error I managed to get it working with a workflow that I personally I feel is easy to work with.<br>
To do this yourself you will need <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Visual Studio Code</a> together with a few extensions.<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Account</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Functions</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Resources</a><br>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
</p>
<h5>Making the app</h5>
<p>
Using the Azure extensions, I login and created a Azure function to interact with our database through the GUI in VSCode and used the following settings:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Language: </strong> C#</li>
    <li><strong>.NET Runtime: </strong> 3.1 LTS</li>
    <li><strong>Template: </strong> HTTP Trigger</li>
    <li><strong>Name: </strong>AddAccount</li>
    <li><strong>Namespace: </strong>Privateer.Register</li>
    <li><strong>Auth level: </strong>Anonymous(This lets anyone call my endpoint)</li>
</ol><br>
This will generate a project with a function for us to work with.<br>
Afterwards create the CosmosDB using the same tool with the settings below:
<ol>
    <li><strong>DB Name: </strong>UserDB</li>
    <li><strong>Collection name: </strong>UserCollection</li>
    <li><strong>Parition key: </strong>/id</li>
</ol><br>
Now before proceeding we'll need our ConnectionString as a variable. This can be copied by right clicking your database in the VSCode GUI. Since we'll initially run our function locally we'll need to store the data in <i>local.settings.json</i>. This will later be stored in Azure as a secret once we commit. <br>
<strong>ATT:</strong> Make sure this file is ignored in Git.<br>
<span style="color: white !important; background-color: gray !important;"><i>"DatabaseString": "AccountEndpoint=ireallylovecookies/;AccountKey=noreallycookiesareamazing.it'saworkofartandwhoevercameupwithitisreallyageniousandwehavehimtothankforeternity."</i></span><br>
Here's an image to demonstrate.<br>

<br>
<strong>Great!</strong> I now had a working database and a function to work with. Now I just need these two interacting with eachother. Naturally the function should be the extroverted one and take contact with the database, so hopping on AddAccount.cs and starting coding was the next step.<br>
The function I had was a good starting template, but useless in my case. Following the Microsoft excercise I added below code to quickly create a document in my database:
<br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cosmosdb/02.jpg"><br>
<i>This just simply adds a document in JSON format containing a random "Account ID" and the ID of the document itself. The thought here was having each Privateer account have a unique ID connected to their account and authorize using that instead of credentials. Inspiration taken from the VPN app "Mullvad".<br>
Although I will be using SQL for this in the future instead.</i>
<br>
<br>
Now pressing <strong>F5</strong> to debug the server and then right clicking the function and running it locally now adds the document to my database. Sweet!<br>

</p>
<h5>Thoughts about the layout</h5>
<p>
    Now the project I had was in my opinion well and mobile. The code is easy to replace since it still contains the core class files. (When the application gets published to Azure, they become non-changeable .JSON files executed from a .DLL file)<br>
    If the layout of the database would have to change, it's easy to adapt by just make a new collection using CosmosDB. Each document is a JSON-file which means could've easily made a query to interchange column data when pushing up to the new collection. <br><br>
    Okay, I know that sentence was hard to follow, let me give you an example:<br><br>
    Let's say our <i>UserCollection</i> for some reason needs to have column changed. The UserID tab now has to be renamed to UniqueID. If this was the case, I could've easily exported the collection as a bundle of JSON-files.<br>
    Afterwards just using simple string formatting replacing each field for each document nad lastly import this data into the new collection and removing the old one.
    <br><br>This was just one ridiculous scenario. But my main point is that it's much more simple than using for instance SQL, this is because it's document-based. Also, this procedure costs nothing since you only pay for throughput. There is no intial cost for re-creating a collection.<br>
    To add to this, the procedure may sound bothersome - but remember probably 90% of this is scriptable which makes it really flexible and simple.
</p>
<h5>Setting up GitHub and CI Pipeline</h5>
<p>
Now, this project was already connected to a Git-repo. If you are following this guide and this hasn't been done, do so now. <br><br>
You can continously deploy the function directly to Azure using the VSCode extension, but something that is much better is making GitHub actions do it for us automatically and thus creating a CI Pipeline.<br>
To just get things going though we'll need to deploy it once using the VSCode extension. This is to get our <i>publish profile</i> which we'll need later.<br>
To do this open the extension and click the button with a cloud and an arrow.<br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cosmosdb/04.jpg"><br><br>
Once it is deployed - access your Azure portal, enter the overview of your function app and click "Download publish profile"<br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cosmosdb/05.jpg"><br><br>
Now keep this document open since you will need to paste this data in GitHub as a secret. To do this navigate to your repository, enter settings and paste the data in a new secret. I named mine <i>AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE</i>.<br>
This data contains sensitive information necessary to authorize your deploy to Azure, that is why we use repository secrets to store this data.
<br><br>
Now we can create a workflow file. This was made by creating a file in the root of the repository and changing the filename to: <i>.github/workflows/devops_ci-pipe.yml</i><br>
This is what my workflow ended up looking like:<br><br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cosmosdb/06.jpg"><br>
<i>First I setup the 3.1 .NET environment on the Ubuntu server to match the one used to drive the function.<br>
Afterwards we build the project with .NET<br>
Lastly we deploy it as a package to Azure using the publish profile we stored in the repository.</i>
</p>
<h5>The workflow and app is complete!</h5>
<p>
    Now we have a function endpoint that we can use to create documents in our database. This function can be called by applications or websites. For instance, I could easily code this directly on my Privateer application.
</p>
<h5>Pricing</h5>
<p>To actually run this, what would it really cost? Well it kind of depends really since we pay per use.<br>
    But to get some kind of number, I used the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Pricing Calculator</a> and made a very simple setup, since we won't need much to run this anyway.
    <br>
    The conclusion became 225 SEK per month. This was by having the free amount of requests for the function which is 1 million executions per month. That is more than enough since the function is only used to create accounts and I doubt I'll be getting more than 1 million users per month.
    <br>
    Regarding the CosmosDB 400 RU/s is enough since we'll not make more than 400 requests per second using this simple setup. <br>
