<h1>What is GitHub Actions?</h1>
<p>GitHub actions is a tool like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;" target="_blank">Jenkins</a> that is used to automate workflow in a project.
  This is done through a so called pipeline where you queue different events to be triggered depending on the configuration. <br><br>
  In this article I'll primarily talk about a CI<i>(Continuous Integration)</i> pipeline.
</p>
<h2>Continuous Integration Pipeline</h2>
<p>
  Basically a CI Pipeline is a method or rather an approach to automate workflow with specific steps so you can deliver a new version of your software.
  Usually a CI Pipeline is combined with CD<i>(Continuous delivery & Continuous deployment)</i> which adds a few more steps, but I'll stick to talking about the part of the process.
  <br><br>
  Continuous Integration combines three vital steps; <strong>Build, Test & Merge.</strong> Through these steps everytime you update your application to your master branch the software will automatically be built, code tested and then merged.
  If any of these steps fails, the process will be stopped. So it is important that you program using TDD<i>(Test-driven development)</i> to make the most of this type of pipeline.

<h2>Implementation of CI in a repository</h2>
<p>In this section I'll display how I implemented a quick CI Pipeline through my test project using GitHub Actions.</p>
