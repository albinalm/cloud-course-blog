<h1>Cloud based database</h1>
<p>For todays post I recently made a quick app to demonstrate how you can use a CosmosDB with Azure together with a REST-API through Azure Functions and automatically deploy using a CI Pipeline.</p>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Well, first of all this wasn't as easy as I first thought. But through some trial and error I managed to get it working with a workflow that I personally I feel is easy to work with.<br>
To do this yourself you will need <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Visual Studio Code</a> together with a few extensions.<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Account</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Functions</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Resources</a><br>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
</p>
<h5>Making the app</h5>
<p>
Using the Azure extensions, I login and created a Azure function to interact with our database through the GUI in VSCode and used the following settings:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Language: </strong> C#</li>
    <li><strong>.NET Runtime: </strong> 3.1 LTS</li>
    <li><strong>Template: </strong> HTTP Trigger</li>
    <li><strong>Name: </strong>AddAccount</li>
    <li><strong>Namespace: </strong>Privateer.Register</li>
    <li><strong>Auth level: </strong>Anonymous(This lets anyone call my endpoint)</li>
</ol><br>
Afterwards creating the CosmosDB using the same tools with the settings below:
<ol>
    <li><strong>DB Name: </strong>UserDB</li>
    <li><strong>Collection name: </strong>UserCollection</li>
    <li><strong>Parition key: </strong>/id</li>
</ol><br>
Now before proceeding we'll need our ConnectionString as a variable. This can be copied by right clicking your database in the VSCode GUI. Since we'll initially run our function locally we'll need to store the data in <i>local.settings.json</i>. This will later be stored in Azure as a secret once we commit. <br>
<strong>ATT:</strong> Make sure this file is ignored in Git.<br>

Here's an image to demonstrate.<br>

<br>
<strong>Great!</strong> I now had a working database and a function to work with. Now I just need these two interacting with eachother. Naturally the function should be the extroverted one and take contact with the database, so hopping on AddAccount.cs and starting coding was the next step.<br>
The function I had was a good starting template, but useless in my case. Following the Microsoft excercise I added below code to quickly create a document in my database:
<br>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/cosmosdb/02.jpg"><br>
<i>This just simply adds a document in JSON format containing a random "Account ID" and the ID of the document itself. The thought here was having each Privateer account have a unique ID connected to their account and authorize using that instead of credentials. Inspiration taken from the VPN app "Mullvad".<br>
Although I will be using SQL for this in the future instead.</i>
<br>
<br>
Now pressing <strong>F5</strong> to debug the server and then right clicking the function and running it locally now adds the document to my database. Sweet!<br>

<h5>Thoughts about the layout</h5>
<p>
    Now the project I had was in my opinion well and mobile. The code is easy to replace since it still contains the core class files. (When the application gets published to Azure, they become non-changeable .JSON files executed from a .DLL file)<br>
    If the layout of the database would have to change, it's easy to adapt by just make a new collection using CosmosDB. Each document is a JSON-file which means could've easily made a query to interchange column data when pushing up to the new collection. <br><br>
    Okay, I know that sentence was hard to follow, let me give you an example:<br><br>
    Let's say our <i>UserCollection</i> for some reason needs to have column changed. The UserID tab now has to be renamed to UniqueID. If this was the case, I could've easily exported the collection as a bundle of JSON-files.<br>
    Afterwards just using simple string formatting replacing each field for each document nad lastly import this data into the new collection and removing the old one.
    <br><br>This was just one ridiculous scenario. But my main point is that it's much more simple than using for instance SQL, this is because it's document-based. Also, this procedure costs nothing since you only pay for throughput. There is no intial cost for re-creating a collection.<br>
    To add to this, the procedure may sound bothersome - but remember probably 90% of this is scriptable which makes it really flexible and simple.
