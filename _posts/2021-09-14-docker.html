<h1>Docker containers and orchestration</h1>

<br>

<h2>What is Docker?</h2>
<p>Docker is a tool to package your application in a so-called "container" which is an isolated runtime environment and OS to guarantee it runs the same on all machines. <br>
Long story short, it's kinda like running the software on a VM but without a hypervisor and unlike a VM, the OS is instead talking directly to the hardware without pre-allocating any resources.</p>
