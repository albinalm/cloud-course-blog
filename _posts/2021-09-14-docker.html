<h1>Docker containers and orchestration</h1>

<br>

<h2>What is Docker?</h2>

<br>

<p>Docker is a tool to package your application in a so-called "container" which is an isolated runtime environment to guarantee it runs the same on all machines without worrying about dependencies and other third party factors.<br>
Long story short, it's kinda like running the software on a VM but without a hypervisor and unlike a VM, the OS is instead talking directly to the hardware without pre-allocating any resources.</p>
<br>
<h3>Tools used for ‚ÄúDockerfying‚Äú</h3>
<p><strong>Docker</strong></p>
<p>To use Docker I obviously need their software which I downloaded and installed from their website.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></p>
<p>My bread and butter in most of my work. VSCode is very barebones which makes it unbloated and a perfect platform to expand upon. <br>Some of my extensions include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Prettier</li>
    <li>Jupyter</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
    <li>YAML</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>
<p>My second wife. My go-to always when developing software.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>First of all i forked an <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;"> ASP.NET reference project</a> from my professor <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Stephan Kaas Johansen</a> to use for this demonstration. <br><br>

When the project had been cloned I opened a local terminal window and added my Dockerfile with the command <strong><i>code Dockerfile</i></strong>.<br>
For this Dockerfile I entered the following code:</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/dockerfile.jpg">
<p>The FROM section specifies my base image in which case I used .NET Core 3.1, but you can replace this with a newer image if desired.
    <br>
    Afterwards I set the destination folder for the container which usually is <i>/app</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now the base image has been set and a workspace for the container been created. Therefore it can now start to copy the project file and running <strong>dotnet restore</strong> to restore all files and dependencies from the project and essentially creating a copy in the container folder. 
    When the project has been restored it will continue by publishing the application.
    <br>
    <br>
   The build image will be set to the same as the base image and the current directory will be set to <i>/app</i>. Lastly it copies the published application to the subdirectory called <i>"out"</i> and specifies the Entrypoint which is the starting parameters.
    <br>
    <span style="size: small !important;"><strong>And thus, the dockerfile is ready to go!</strong></span>
</p>
<h4>Setting up image pushing on the GitHub Actions Pipeline</h4>

<br>

<h5>Preparing credentials</h5>
<p>When I first arrived at GitHub I had to prepare some credential variables before I could start working on my docker image.<br>
This is done by creating a <strong><i>personal access token</i></strong> through my GitHub account and afterwards adding that code to my repository secrets under the name "SECURITY_TOKEN". <br><br>

To do this I first had to setup my access token by going to <strong>My Account > Developer settings > Personal Access tokens</strong>.</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/pat_settings.jpg">
<p>Saving the code to the clipboard I entered the repository and set it as a secret under <strong>Settings > Secrets > Repository secrets</strong></p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/repo_secrets.jpg">

<br> <br>

<h5>Programming the workflow</h5>
<p>Now that I have prepared my access token I can begin setting up my Docker workflow. The Docker image itself will be configured using the Dockerfile we created earlier. <br>
The YML-configuration file became the following:</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/docker-workflow.jpg">
<p>The job is set to be activated everytime a merge or push to the master branch occurs through the <i>‚Äúon‚Äú</i> parameter.
<br>
<br>
The job begins with an authorization to GitHub via GitHub Container Registry<i>(ghcr.io)</i> using the prepared credentials. When the authorization is complete it can start building and pushing the image.
<br><br>
I set the context to the entire directory using the ‚Äú . ‚Äú, and the push parameter to true since one of the points of this article is pushing the image to the cloud. 
<br>
The <i>‚Äú:latest‚Äú</i> tag specifies that I wish to package the latest version of my application.
</p>
<h4>Finishing up</h4>

<br>

<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/successful_pipe.jpg">
<p>And boom! The application will now be packaged and imaged everytime we release a new version through the master branch.
    <br> <br>
To test it out I pulled the image from the cloud using the following commands:<br>
<strong><i>> docker login ghcr.io --username albinalm --password ghp_myawesometoken</i></strong><br>
<i> (We specify to authorize towards GitHub Container Registry by adding ghcr.io)</i><br>
<strong><i>> docker pull ghcr.io/albinalm/simplewebhalloworld:latest</i></strong> <br>
<strong><i>> docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name simplehalloworld ghcr.io/albinalm/simplewebhalloworld</i></strong> <br><br>
Works like a charm and the application can be reached on localhost port 8080.</p>
