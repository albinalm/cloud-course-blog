<h1>Docker containers and orchestration</h1>

<br>

<h2>What is Docker?</h2>

<br>

<p>Docker is a tool to package your application in a so-called "container" which is an isolated runtime environment and OS to guarantee it runs the same on all machines. <br>
Long story short, it's kinda like running the software on a VM but without a hypervisor and unlike a VM, the OS is instead talking directly to the hardware without pre-allocating any resources.</p>
<br>
<h3>Tools used for ‚ÄúDockerfying‚Äú</h3>
<p><strong>Docker</strong></p>
<p>To use Docker I obviously need their software which I downloaded and installed from their website.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></p>
<p>My bread and butter in most of my work. VSCode is very barebones which makes it unbloated and a perfect platform to expand upon. <br>Some of my extensions include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Prettier</li>
    <li>Jupyter</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
    <li>YAML</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>
<p>My second wife. My go-to always when developing software.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>First of all i forked an <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;"> ASP.NET reference project</a> from my professor <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Stephan Kaas Johanssen</a> to use for this demonstration. <br><br>

When the project had been cloned down I opened a local terminal window and added my Dockerfile with the command <strong><i>code Dockerfile</i></strong>.<br>
For this Dockerfile I entered the following code:</p>
<img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/dockerimaging/dockerfile.jpg">
<p>The FROM section specifies my base image in which case I used .NET Core 3.1, but you can replace this with a newer image if desired.
    <br>
    Afterwards I set the destination folder for the container which usually is <i>/app</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, we have set the base image and created a workspace for the container. Therefore we start to copy the project file and then running dotnet restore, to restore all files from the project and essentially creating a copy of the project in the container. 
    When the project has been restored we follow up with publishing it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lastly I specify my build image which is the same as the base image and set the current directory to <i>/app</i>. Lastly we copy the published project to the subdirectory called <i>"out"</i> and then specify the Entrypoint which is the starting parameters.
    <br>
    <strong>The dockerfile is ready to go!</strong>
