<h1>Docker containers and orchestration</h1>

<br>

<h2>What is Docker?</h2>

<br>

<p>Docker is a tool to package your application in a so-called "container" which is an isolated runtime environment and OS to guarantee it runs the same on all machines. <br>
Long story short, it's kinda like running the software on a VM but without a hypervisor and unlike a VM, the OS is instead talking directly to the hardware without pre-allocating any resources.</p>
<br>
<h3>Tools used for ‚ÄúDockerfying‚Äú</h3>
<p><strong>Docker</strong></p>
<p>To use Docker I obviously need their software which I downloaded and installed from their website.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></p>
<p>My bread and butter in most of my work. VSCode is very barebones which makes it unbloated and a perfect platform to expand upon. <br>Some of my extensions include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Prettier</li>
    <li>Jupyter</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
    <li>YAML</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>
<p>My second wife. My go-to always when developing software.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>First of all i forked an <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;"> ASP.NET reference project</a> from my professor <a href="https://github.com/skjohansen" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Stephan Kaas Johanssen</a> to use for this demonstration. <br>
When the project had been cloned down I opened a local terminal window and added my Dockerfile with the command <span style="color: yellow !important;"><strong><i>code</span> Dockerfile</i></strong>.</p>
