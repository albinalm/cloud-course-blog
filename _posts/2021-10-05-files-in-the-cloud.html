<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>What is an Azure Blob?</h3>
<p>
    Well to keep it short, an Azure blob is basically a literal big blob of data.
    It can be several files or just one file. You can then read the bytes of the blob to a new file or write additional bytes to the blob.

    The pros of a blob is mnany, but one of them is that it's quite simple in  it's design. It does not use any fancy standards like POSIX and thus the straightforward design makes it simple to extend, but also simple to use on several platforms.<br>
    For this blog post I made a console application to emulate an Azure Blob.
