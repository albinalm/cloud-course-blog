<h1>Making a static web app in Azure using Azure functions to gather data</h1>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
In this article I'll explain how I made a website using Azure Static Web App, gathering data through Azure functions together with React front-end. <br>
Obviously we will incorporate a CI pipeline through this project, like we have done with all the earlier ones.

<h5>Creating the foundation</h5>
To begin I made a foundation using React with the command <strong><i>"npx create-react-app MyFirstApp"</i></strong>. To install this command you can get it from npm with <strong><i>"npm i create-react-app"</i></strong>
