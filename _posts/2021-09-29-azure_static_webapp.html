<h1>Making a static web app in Azure using Azure functions to gather data</h1><br>
<h5>Introduction</h5><br>
In this article I'll explain how I made a website using Azure Static Web App, gathering data through Azure functions together with React front-end. <br>
Obviously we will incorporate a CI pipeline through this project, like we have done with all the earlier ones.<br>
<br>
<h5>Creating the foundation</h5><br>
To begin I made a foundation using React with the command <strong><i>"npx create-react-app MyFirstApp"</i></strong>. To install this command you can get it from NPM with <strong><i>"npm i create-react-app"</i></strong><br>
This will give us a startup project with React containing all necessary modules and plugins to immediately debug the website.
Afterwards to simplify debugging I had to install Yarn. This was done via NPM with <strong><i>"npm install --global yarn"</i></strong><br>
At this point you should have a project tree looking something like this:<br>

<i>"Minus the api folder of course which we'll get to later."</i><br><br>
Once you're set, test the application using the command <strong><i>npm start</i></strong>. You should be presented with the following:<br>

If all succeeds, we need to build the application using the comnmand <strong><i>yarn build</i></strong> This will publish the webiste to a new folder called "build". It's important we remove that folder from the .gitignore file, since thats the folder where Azure will fetch our website later.


</p>
<h5>Setting up the GitHub pipeline</h5>
<p>
    The next step is setting all of this up to GitHub and then publish it to Azure from there. <br><br>
    First of all your project will need to be connected to a repository. You can do this in many ways.
    I usually just create a repository, clone it and paste all the content then pushing. I know you can do it by git commandline, but I am a rebel like that ok?<br>
    Afterwards we have our working react app connected to GitHub. Now it's setting up the connection to Azure and implementing our function as an API.<br>
    <br>
    This is done by logging into Azure Portal and just creating a new static web app. Once you're presented with the different options you will have to pick the following:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name: </strong><i>Optional</i></li>
        <li><strong>Plan: </strong>Free</li>
        <li><strong>Region: </strong><i>Optional</i></li>
        <li><strong>Source: </strong>GitHub
        <br><i>Here you login and select your repository.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Presets: </strong>React</li>
        <li><strong>App location: </strong>/</li>
        <li><strong>API-location: </strong>api</li>
        <li><strong>Build location: </strong>build</li>
    </ul><br>
    Create your app and wait a few minutes for it to finish.
    Then visit the address in the overview page of your newly created Azure app and you should be presented with the same React logo as when you debugged earlier.
    This process should also automatically add a workflow file. <a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Reference here.</a>

<h5>Adding Azure Functions</h5><br>
<p>
    Now we have our website connected to Azure and GitHub. The only thing left is adding content!
    For this demonstration I just simply connected an API telling us a good ol' hello.<br>
    To do this you first need to install the extension <a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue !important;">Azure Static Web Apps</a><br>
    Then press <strong><i>F1</i></strong> to open the command field and then you search for <strong><i>Azure Static Web Apps: Create HTTP-function</i></strong>
    Select the following settings:<br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Language: </strong>JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Name: </strong> message</li>
    </ul><br>
    This will generate an Azure Functions project in your file tree. It should be located in a new folder called <strong><i>"api"</i></strong>.
    Open <strong><i>index.js</i></strong> in your Azure Functions project and enter below code:<br>
    <a href="#" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://techshelter.albin.dev/img/posts/azure_static_app/03.jpg">
    </a><br>
    <i>Click the image to arrive at source if you wish to copy contents.</i><br><br>
    This code will send a response containing the <i>"text object"</i> with the contents we added. Now we just need to make our start-page ask for this content on load.<br><br>
