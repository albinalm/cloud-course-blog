<h1>Making a static web app in Azure using Azure functions to gather data</h1>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
In this article I'll explain how I made a website using Azure Static Web App, gathering data through Azure functions together with React front-end. <br>
Obviously we will incorporate a CI pipeline through this project, like we have done with all the earlier ones.

<h5>Creating the foundation</h5>
To begin I made a foundation using React with the command <strong><i>"npx create-react-app MyFirstApp"</i></strong>. To install this command you can get it from NPM with <strong><i>"npm i create-react-app"</i></strong><br>
This will give us a startup project with React.
Afterwards to simplify debugging I had to install Yarn. This was done via NPM with <strong><i>"npm install --global yarn"</i></strong><br>
At this point you should have a project tree looking something like this:<br>

<i>Minus the api folder of course which we'll get to later.</i></p>
<h5>Setting up the GitHub pipeline</h5>
<p>
    The next step is setting all of this up to GitHub and then publish it to Azure from there.
