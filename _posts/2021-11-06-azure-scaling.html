<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h2>What does "Scaling" mean?</h2>
<p>Scaling basically means that the hardware that is powering your service or application increases or decreases in performance depending on your need.
    <br>This might range from network bandwidth to CPU cores. Scaling could also mean just adding more computers to do the work for you.
<br><br>Depending on how you increase/decrease performance, the name of the scaling type will vary. This is to clarify in what way you wish to up- or downscale.
<br>
<h3>Vertical scaling</h3>
<br>
Scaling vertically basically means improving what you already have. This is most often by adding additional CPU Cores, RAM, Disk space and more. Many times even all at once.<br>
The goal is to resize your capacity without altering any code. There is several benefits of this, with one of them being fast and efficient. Though the major downside is that you are capped at the maximum capacity of the server.
This is proven to be the most cost effective way to scale since when done automatically it just adds the power necessary to meet the demands. Also, it's very straightforward and requires minimal to no configuration on the application service to work.
It's elegant and simple. Just add more sauce.
